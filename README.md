# XR Project: Object Destruction and Explosion Interaction Variants (Week 10)

## Project Overview

This project explores multiple approaches to a core VR interaction: triggering an object's destruction and causing an explosion. The objective was to implement variations of this interaction to observe how each version impacted user engagement, comfort, and immersion. Each method allows users to achieve the same outcome—an explosive reaction—through distinct actions, encouraging experimentation and providing insights into user preferences for interaction styles in VR.

## Interaction Variants

1. **Shooting the Object**: Users trigger an explosion by aiming and shooting at the object, providing a direct and immediate response to their action.

2. **Stepping on a Trap**: In this variation, users trigger the explosion by stepping on a designated trap tile, introducing an indirect mechanism and an element of anticipation.

3. **Grabbing and Throwing the Object**: Users grab the object and throw it, causing it to explode upon impact with a wall, adding a physical, hands-on interaction.

Each variation builds on the same core interaction but offers unique methods of engagement:
- **Direct**: Shooting
- **Indirect**: Trap
- **Physical**: Throwing

Testing these variations provided insight into user preferences and the different levels of immersion and intuitiveness each variant offered.

## User Testing Summary

User testing was conducted with seven volunteers to evaluate each interaction's intuitiveness, enjoyability, and immersion level. Pre- and post-test questions were used to capture their background and impressions, and observations were noted throughout the testing process.

### Pre-Test Insights

Most participants had limited VR experience, typically having used a VR headset once or twice before, with this class providing their first significant exposure. However, they were generally comfortable with gaming-style VR interactions like slicing, shooting, walking, and stepping, especially from games like *Beat Saber* and *Superhot*, or other VR experiences involving first-person exploration and virtual tours.

### Observations and Post-Test Insights

Each interaction affected users' experiences uniquely, and initial expectations were largely met:
- **Shooting** felt intuitive due to users’ gaming backgrounds.
- **Trap stepping** added suspense.
- **Grab-and-throw** added a satisfying, tactile component.

#### Observations by Interaction

- **Shooting the Object**
  - **User Reactions**: Users quickly understood this mechanic, finding it straightforward and natural. Familiarity with VR shooting mechanics made it an effortless choice.
  - **Suggested Improvements**: None

- **Stepping on a Trap**
  - **User Reactions**: This method introduced a cautious approach, with users pausing before stepping on the trap. This added a sense of tension that some described as similar to a “booby trap” or hidden danger, though it felt slightly out of context in this project setting.
  - **Suggested Improvements**: Only certain traps triggered explosions by design, but users misunderstood this as a malfunction, assuming some traps were broken. In future versions, clearer visual cues could indicate which traps are active.

- **Grabbing and Throwing the Object**
  - **User Reactions**: This was the most popular interaction, combining control, timing, and physical engagement. Users enjoyed the challenge and felt more immersed due to the direct manipulation involved in throwing.
  - **Suggested Improvements**: Users recommended making the object smaller and lighter, positioning the wall closer for easier impact, and ensuring the object doesn’t pass through the floor.

## Pre- and Post-Test Questions

### Pre-Test Questions

1. Have you used VR applications before? If yes, what types of interactions were involved?
2. Are you familiar with VR interactions that involve destroying objects or triggering explosions? If so, in what context?
3. How comfortable do you feel using VR controllers for specific actions like holding, stepping, or throwing?

### Post-Test Questions

1. Which interaction (shooting, stepping on a trap, or throwing) felt the most intuitive or enjoyable? Why?
2. Which interaction felt the most challenging or required the most effort to perform effectively?
3. Is there anything you would change about the interactions to make them feel more natural or engaging?

## Reflections and Conclusions

This project provided valuable insights into how users respond to different interaction styles within a single VR experience. Users overwhelmingly favored the grab-and-throw interaction for its physicality and satisfaction, while shooting was intuitive due to gaming familiarity. The trap interaction added a unique element of suspense but may require clearer feedback for users to understand its activation.

Ultimately, testing these variants demonstrated the importance of tailored feedback and customization in VR design. Direct, hands-on actions like grabbing and throwing resonate well with users, as they provide a sense of control and immersion, especially for tasks involving timing and skill.


# Project Proposal - Interaction Description (Week 7)
The user will perform different actions that will trigger an explosion for an object in the scene.

1. **Shooting** - The user will aim their controller and shoot bullets at the object. Once the bullet hits the object it will trigger an explosion.

2. **Trap/Land mine** - The user will press a button to teleport throughout the scene. If the user steps on a the dedicated teleportation tile which is a trap/mine the object will explode.

3. **Remote controlled** - The user will press a button on the controller to trigger the explosion.

**_Additional interactions (optional)_**

4. **Pick up and throw** - User picks up the object and throws it. The object explodes on impact with the wall in the scene.

5. **Voice-controlled** - User says a word like "boom" or "explode" and the object in the scene explodes.
